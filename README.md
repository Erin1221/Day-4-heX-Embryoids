# Reconstructing Lineage Trajectories and Fate Decisions in Day 4 heX-Embryoids
Understanding how human embryonic lineages diversify immediately after implantation remains a major challenge in developmental biology. This period—when the epiblast, hypoblast, amnion, and early yolk sac derivatives emerge—is difficult to study in vivo. To address this gap, our laboratory developed the heX-embryoid system, a genetically engineered human stem-cell model that self-organizes into key post-implantation–like structures, including an epiblast–hypoblast bilayer, an amniotic-like epithelium, anterior and posterior signaling domains, yolk sac endoderm, yolk sac mesoderm, and early blood-forming progenitors.
Although these major cell populations have been described, the developmental relationships between them remained unresolved. Using single-cell RNA-seq, I applied Slingshot to a Seurat-integrated UMAP to reconstruct lineage structure. Slingshot revealed multiple independent trajectories, with the WT epiblast, WT posterior, and WT amnion forming a separate island and consistently occupying early pseudotime. Because these WT clusters do not bridge into the GATA6-induced compartment, Slingshot did not extend trajectories through the amnion, which is consistent with its biology as an epiblast-derived lineage. In contrast, the GATA6-induced cells formed distinct trajectories toward yolk sac endoderm, anterior hypoblast-like cells, and yolk sac mesoderm.
To complement pseudotime ordering with directional fate tendencies, I applied CellRank using a velocity-free ConnectivityKernel. GPCCA coarse-graining identified terminal macrostates corresponding to the major iGATA6-derived extra-embryonic fates, and fate-probability maps showed progressive convergence of intermediate cells toward these states. As with Slingshot, CellRank did not assign the amnion as a terminal or intermediate state, reinforcing its early and independent specification.
Together, Slingshot and CellRank provide a coherent, time-ordered, and probabilistic reconstruction of lineage progression in day-4 heX-embryoids, highlighting both the diversification of extra-embryonic yolk sac lineages and the distinct developmental path of the WT-derived amnion.
